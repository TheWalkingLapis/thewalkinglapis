## Hey, I'm Max aka. TheWalkingLapis :)

I ...
- will soon finish my Master's degree in Computer Science (with Focus on Computer Graphics)
- like to participate in Game Jams (DM me if you're looking for a programmer ;D)
- primarily use Godot for GameDev (currently learning UE5 as well)
- am most skilled with C++ and Python (and pyTorch), as well as OpenGL (trying to learn Vulkan too)

Check out my [Portfolio](https://thewalkinglapis.github.io/) (WIP)
